<h3>How it processes your video</h3>
<p>Social media upload filters compare your content against a database of copyrighted media for similar patterns. By
  modifying the waveform, we change the audio patterns with minimal impact on the sound you hear.</p>

  relevant social media platform&rsquo;s terms of use and only modify content that is not violating or infringing
  applicable law and/or any third-party rights. This tool is made to share video documents that you have created
  yourself. You must not, and may not, use this tool to modify, use or distribute copyrighted media under infringement
